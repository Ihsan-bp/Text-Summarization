      "[\"Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\", \"A drunk teenage boy had to be rescued by security after jumping into a lions' enclosure at a zoo in western India. Rahul Kumar, 17, clambered over the enclosure fence at the\\xa0Kamla Nehru Zoological Park in Ahmedabad, and began running towards the animals, shouting he would 'kill them'. Mr Kumar explained afterwards that he was drunk and 'thought I'd stand a good chance' against the predators. Next level drunk: Intoxicated Rahul Kumar, 17, climbed into the lions' enclosure at a zoo in Ahmedabad and began running towards the animals shouting 'Today I kill a lion!' Mr Kumar had been sitting near the enclosure when he suddenly made a dash for the lions, surprising zoo security. The intoxicated teenager ran towards the lions, shouting: 'Today I kill a lion or a lion kills me!' A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation. 'Fortunately for him, the lions were asleep and the zoo guards acted quickly enough to prevent a tragedy similar to that in Delhi.' Last year a 20-year-old man was mauled to death by a tiger in the Indian capital after climbing into its enclosure at the city zoo.\"]\n"

      "Enter the text to summarize: Liverpool target Neto is also wanted by PSG and clubs in Spain as Brendan Rodgers faces stiff competition to land the Fiorentina goalkeeper, according to the Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna. The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from\\xa0Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.\n",

A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation. 'Fortunately for him, the lions were asleep and the zoo guards acted quickly enough to prevent a tragedy similar to that in Delhi.' Last year a 20-year-old man was mauled to death by a tiger in the Indian capital after climbing into its enclosure at the city zoo.\n",

       "\"Liverpool target Neto is also wanted by PSG and clubs in Spain as Brendan Rodgers faces stiff competition to land the Fiorentina goalkeeper, according to the Brazilian's agent Stefano Castagna. The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from\\xa0Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.\""

    "# Automated Text Summarization Project\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
    "Text summarization is a challenging task in natural language processing that aims to generate concise and coherent summaries from large pieces of text. In this report, we present an approach using the T5 and BART models for text summarization. We discuss the results obtained from both models and explore their potential applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Approach</h3>\n",
    "<b>Data Preparation:</b> We gathered a dataset consisting of news articles with corresponding highlights. The dataset was preprocessed to remove any unnecessary information and ensure the articles were in a suitable format for summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Model</h3>\n",
    "<h3>T5</h3>\n",
    "We utilized the T5 model, specifically the \"Einmalumdiewelt/T5-Base_GNAD\" variant, for text summarization.\n",
    "The T5 tokenizer was used to tokenize the articles and generate input tokens.\n",
    "We implemented the \"t5_summarize\" function to generate summaries using the T5 model with adjustable parameters such as the number of beams and the maximum number of words in the summary.\n",
    "We evaluated the T5 model's performance using the ROUGE scores, which measure the quality of the generated summaries compared to reference summaries.\n",
    "<h3>BART</h3>\n",
    "We employed the BART model, specifically the \"facebook/bart-large-cnn\" variant, for text summarization.\n",
    "The BART tokenizer was used to tokenize the articles and create input tokens.\n",
    "We implemented the \"bart_summarize\" function to generate summaries using the BART model with adjustable parameters.\n",
    "The BART model's performance was also evaluated using ROUGE scores.\n",
    "<h3>Results</h3>\n",
    "Here are the ROUGE scores for both models:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the T5 model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ROUGE-1 F1-score: 0.507\n",
    "2. ROUGE-2 F1-score: 0.265\n",
    "3. ROUGE-L F1-score: 0.478\n",
    "\n",
    "For the BART model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ROUGE-1 F1-score: 0.5610\n",
    "2. ROUGE-2 F1-score: 0.3111\n",
    "3. ROUGE-L F1-score: 0.5610\n",
    "<h3>Discussion</h3>\n",
    "It's evident that the BART model outperforms the T5 model across all three ROUGE metrics (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L) in terms of F1-score. Therefore, based on these ROUGE scores, the BART model is the better-performing model for generating summaries in the given context. It has higher precision, recall, and F1-scores for all three ROUGE measures, indicating better overall summary quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Applications</h3>\n",
    "The automatic text summarization approach using the T5 and BART models has various potential applications:\n",
    "News Aggregation: Summarizing news articles can help users quickly get an overview of current events without reading entire articles.\n",
    "Document Summarization: Summarizing lengthy documents or research papers can assist researchers and professionals in identifying key information efficiently.\n",
    "Social Media Analysis: Summarizing user-generated content on social media platforms can aid in understanding trends, sentiment analysis, and monitoring discussions.\n",
    "Content Generation: Summarization models can be utilized as part of content generation systems to produce concise summaries of generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n",
    "In conclusion, based on the performance metrics obtained from comparing two OpenAI language models (T5 and BART) on a text summarization task, the BART model has consistently outperformed the T5 model across all key ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L). The BART model achieved higher F1-scores, indicating better precision and recall in generating summaries. Therefore, the recommendation for the best model for the text summarization task is the BART model, as it has demonstrated superior performance in generating high-quality summaries according to the provided metrics.\n"
